          <h2>Explanation</h2>
          <p>Let's start with what you can observe by just looking at the sign, it's supposed to be a <span>bycicle</span>. There is also a <span>red stripe</span> crossing the sign, this means something <span>stops</span> or is <span>forbidden</span>. Knowing this makes it easier to understand the signs meaning.</p>
          <p>Now for the shape and color, as you can see the sign is <span>round</span> and <span>blue</span>. The round and blue combination in road signs means there is a <span>requirement</span>, the vehicle (or pedestrian) portrayed on the sign is required to drive on the road or path where the sign is placed.</p>
          <p>So, the sign is round, blue, portrayes a bycicle and has a red stripe crossing it. This means that from where the sign is located, the biking path you were required to bike on stops. When you see this sign you need to stop biking on the path where the sign is located and find a new biking path to bike on.</p>

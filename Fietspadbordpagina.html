          <h2>Explanation</h2>
          <p>Let's start with what you can observe by just looking at the sign, it's supposed to be a <span>moped</span> (top) and a <span>bycicle</span> (bottom). Knowing this makes it easier to understand the signs meaning.</p>
          <p>Now for the shape and color, as you can see the sign is <span>round</span> and <span>blue</span>. The round and blue combination in road signs means there is a <span>requirement</span>, the vehicle (or pedestrian) portrayed on the sign is required to drive on the road or path where the sign is placed.</p>
          <p>So, the sign is round, blue and portrayes a moped and a bycicle. This means that when you see this sign you need to bike on the path where te sign is located. But be careful, since you'll not only have bycicles passing you but mopeds as well.</p>

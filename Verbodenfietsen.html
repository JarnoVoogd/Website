          <h2>Explanation</h2>
          <p>Let's start with what you can observe by just looking at the sign, it's supposed to be a <span>bycicle</span>.  Knowing this makes it easier to understand the signs meaning.</p>
          <p>Now for the shape and color, as you can see the sign is <span>round</span> and has a <span>red circle</span> around the edge. The round and red circle combination in road signs means there is a <span>restriction</span>, the vehicle (or pedestrian) portrayed on the sign is forbidden to drive on the road or path where the sign is placed.</p>
          <p>So, the sign is round, has a red circle around the edge and portrayes a bycicle. This means that from where the sign is located, bicycles are forbidden to drive that path/road. When you see this sign you need to stop biking on the path where the sign is located and find a new biking path to bike on.</p>
